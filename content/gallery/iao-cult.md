The IAO’s first experimental project was a transmedia collaboration around the concept of cultism, with filmmaker [Mark Harris](https://megamarkharris.wordpress.com/) and perfumer Josh Meyer of [Imaginary Authors.](http://imaginaryauthors.com/)


In November of 2012, Meyer and Harris began a process of discussion to create an olfactory element to the storyworld Harris developed around ‘The Lost Children.’ The collaboration revolved around the themes of cultism, brainwashing, obedience and initiation–concepts that Meyer then used to inform the construction of the IAO’s first scent. The result of this olfactory experiment was an integral part of the transmedia campaign that Harris designed alongside his film, culminating in two live [immersive experiences](http://www.filmlinc.org/films/the-lost-children/) at The Film Society of Lincoln Center’s Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center, in New York, in January of 2013.
