A promo clip for [Deep Dark](http://deepdarkmovie.com). This was meant to be the Hole’s video-diary of her time spent with Thomas Kinkade, Painter of Light™. Thomas Kinkade was one of the most successful American painters in his lifetime but was overwhelmingly derided by the fine-art world. Is it kitsch, true art, or both? In an interview Kinkade proclaimed, “I am really the most controversial artist in the world.”
